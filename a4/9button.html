  <p>The framework provides an easy set up for displaying buttons. To a display a button in a particular part of a page, please identify the appropriate line in the html file being used and insert the following lines of code.  You would also need the link or file name that the button is being used for.</p>
  <xmp>
      <button><a href="filename.html">Button content</a></button>
  </xmp>
  <p>The above line of code is all we need to display a button .  In the section in quotes next to "href" you would insert the name of the html file or url to link.
