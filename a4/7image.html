  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <p>The framework provides an easy set up for displaying images.  It is generally a good idea to have images consistent in size to the webpage and each other. There are various tools to crop images online.  The folder downloded for this framework has a folder called "images".  This is where all images need to be saved.  To a display an image in a particular part of a page, please identify the appropriate line in the html file being used and insert the following line of code:</p>
  <xmp>
    <p><img src="images/filename.jpg" alt="description"></p>
  </xmp>
  <p>In the above line of code, you would put the file name for the picture just after the forward slash, and a description of the picture just after the alt=. The image would display in the default style with a frame with rounded corners. Customization options are available for border color.</p>
