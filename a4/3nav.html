  <h2>Navigation Bar</h2>
  <p>The navigation bar is the section of the page on top, with the header on the top left and navigation menu links on the top right.  By default, three navigation links (menu items) are provided.  However, it is possible to have any number from one to four (or more) navigation links through this framework. Around four are recommended. It is also possible to have no links for a single page website - you just delete .</p>
  <p>The relevant section to work on for the navigation bar are lines 12 to 18 of the starter file.  The relevant code is also displayed below.</p>
  <xmp>
    <nav>
      <ul>
          <li class="box" id="navpart1"><a href="nav1.html">Nav 1</a></li>
          <li class="box" id="navpart2"><a href="nav2.html">Nav 2</a></li>
          <li class="box" id="navpart3"><a href="nav3.html">Nav 3</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </xmp>
  <p>Of these lines, lines 12, 13 and 14 (3rd, 4th and 5th in the sample above) list the content for the three menu items.  To add a fourth (or more) navigation item, simply copy the content of one of these lines and insert it directly below. To reduce the number, you just delete a line. Once you have the right number of navigation item lines, you would need to make the following changes to the content of each line:
    1)  id - give the section an ID relevant to the page (1 word, lower case)
    2)  href - here you will see a section in quotation marks.  Thiis is where you put the file name of the second page.  Each page can be made using the starter page provided, but saved with a different name in the same folder.
    3)  menu - this is inserted directly after, in the same line. You would replace the words "Nav 1" with the menu item name
