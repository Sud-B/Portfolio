  <h2>Borders & Boxes</h2>
  <h3>Borders</h3>
    <p>Any section of a web page can be marked out by surrounding it with a border.  As an example, this page has a border around the header and also around the main page. To place a border around a section of a page, you would use the code provided below.  The first line should be placed BEFORE the first line of code in the section.  The last line should be placed AFTER the last line of code.  This ensures that the border wraps around the section.  As an example, in the sample page where the page has been divided into 2 sections, we now put a border around each section.  The sample page can be viewed below. </p>
    <button><a href="starter4.html">Borders Sample page</a></button>
    <p>Code to do this is provided below.</p>
    <xmp>
    <section class="border">
      <h2>Your sub section heading</h2>
      <p>Your subsection content</p>
    </section>
    </xmp>
    <p>To create the border, the first line is placed before the relevant content and the last line after the relevant content.</p>
    <h3>Boxes</h3>
      <p>A webpage (or part/section of) can further be divided into a box (content could include text or image).  There are many examples of these on this website on the main and instructions page. A sample is also provided below.  Similar to creating a border, there are two lines of code required to create a box. The first line is placed BEFORE the first line of code in the section.  The last line is placed AFTER the last line of the section.</p>
        <button><a href="starter5.html">Box Sample page</a></button>
      <p>Code to do this is provided below.</p>
      <xmp>
        <div class="box">
          <h2>THIS IS A BOX</h2>
        </div>
      </xmp>
      <p>The next section (Columns & Rows) explains how to make columns and rows with boxes (or other content).</p>
