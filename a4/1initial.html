  <h2>Initial steps</h2>
  <h3>Download folder</h3>
    <p>The first step would be to download a starting folder. There are three default color schemes (black is the same as this website).  Customization options for color are provided in the instructions section so all background and border colors can be changed. Zipped versions of the folders are available to download below as per the default color schemes.</p>
  <section class="display1-3">
    <div class="box">
      <h3>Black</h3><button>
        <a href="starter1.html">Sample page</a></button><button><a href="http://sudhirb.sgedu.site/a4black.zip">DOWNLOAD</a></button>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h3>Blue</h3>
        <button><a href="starter1blue.html">Sample page</a></button><button><a href="http://sudhirb.sgedu.site/a4blue.zip">DOWNLOAD</a></button>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h3>Red</h3>
        <button><a href="starter1red.html">Sample page</a></button><button><a href="http://sudhirb.sgedu.site/a4red.zip">DOWNLOAD</a></button>
    </div>
  </section>
  <h3>Text Editor and first page</h3>
	 <p>An editor for HTML will be needed. Any editor should work fine.  The first file to open in your editor after unzipping the downloaded folder is called index.html and relevant sections to work on are shown in the next block on page sections in the instructions page. Always keep the html file for your main page with the name index.html.</p>
   <h3>Installation (when you finish making all your changes)</h3>
   <p>You will now need to change the name of the completed folder to name relevant to your website.  You will also need to have an account with a web host service. The completed folder needs to be transferred to the public folder of your hosting account. Your site name will be the hostname/foldername/ and this will automatically open the page on the index.html file.  This is why that name needs to be retained.</p>
