  <h2>Media Queries</h2>
  <p>This framework has been set up with 2 media queries by default.  These are described below</p>
  <h3>Adapation to different screen size</h3>
  <p>The framework adapts at 900 pixels (a little over tablet size) and below, to adapt with the smaller screen size.  At this screen size, the navigation bar in the header adapts from having the header on the right and navigation menu on the left to having the header on top across the entire screen with the navigation menu directly below, also across the entire screen.  This gives both items more space for the smaller screen width.</p>The framework adapts again for mobile screen at screen width of 630 pixels. At this point it adapts to reduce the thickness of all borders in the header to give more room.</p>
  <h3>Adaptation to devices without mouse/click (touch devices)</h3>
  <p>The framework has built in adjustment to hover for non pointer devices by responding to them as well.</p>
